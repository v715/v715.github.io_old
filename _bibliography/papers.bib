  abstract = {A connectome is a map of the structural and/or functional connections in the brain. This information-rich representation has the potential to transform our understanding of the relationship between patterns in brain connectivity and neurological processes, disorders, and diseases. However, existing computational techniques used to analyze connectomes are often insufficient for interrogating multi-subject connectomics datasets. Several methods are either solely designed to analyze single connectomes, or leverage heuristic graph invariants that ignore the complete topology of connections between brain regions. To enable more rigorous comparative connectomics analysis, we introduce robust and interpretable statistical methods motivated by recent theoretical advances in random graph models. These methods enable simultaneous analysis of multiple connectomes across different scales of network topology, facilitating the discovery of hierarchical brain structures that vary in relation with phenotypic profiles. We validated these methods through extensive simulation studies, as well as synthetic and real-data experiments. Using a set of high-resolution connectomes obtained from genetically distinct mouse strains (including the BTBR mouse -- a standard model of autism -- and three behavioral wild-types), we show that these methods uncover valuable latent information in multi-subject connectomics data and yield novel insights into the connective correlates of neurological phenotypes.},

  title = {Pre-{{HAART CD4}}+ {{T}}-Lymphocytes as Biomarkers of Post-{{HAART}} Immune Recovery in {{HIV}}-Infected Children with or without {{TB}} Co-Infection},
  abstract={
    Infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) dramatically increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). Several studies have indicated that co-infection with TB increases the risk of HIV progression and death. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the brunt of these dual epidemics, with about 2.4 million HIV-infected people living with TB. The main objective of our study was to assess whether the pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts and percentages could serve as biomarkers for post-HAART treatment immune-recovery in HIV-positive children with and without TB co-infection.
    The data analyzed in this retrospective study were collected from a cohort of 305 HIV-infected children being treated with HAART. A Lehmann family of ROC curves were used to assess the diagnostic performance of pre- HAART treatment CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage as biomarkers for post-HAART immune recovery. The Kaplan–Meier estimator was used to compare differences in post-HAART recovery times between patients with and without TB co-infection.
    We found that the diagnostic performance of both pre-HARRT treatment CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage was comparable and achieved accuracies as high as 74%. Furthermore, the predictive capability of pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage were slightly better in TB-negative patients. Our analyses also indicate that TB-negative patients have a shorter recovery time compared to the TB-positive patients.
    Pre-HAART CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and percentage are stronger predictors of immune recovery in TB-negative pediatric patients, suggesting that TB co-infection complicates the treatment of HIV in this cohort. These findings suggest that the detection and treatment of TB is essential for the effectiveness of HAART in HIV-infected pediatric patients.

  title = {A {{Comparison}} of {{Machine Learning Techniques}} for {{Classification}} of {{HIV Patients}} with {{Antiretroviral Therapy}}-{{Induced Mitochondrial Toxicity}} from Those {{Without Mitochondrial Toxicity}}},
  abstract={
    Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has significantly reduced HIV-related morbidity and mortality. However, therapeutic benefit of ART is often limited by delayed drug-associated toxicity. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are the backbone of ART regimens. NRTIs compete with endogenous deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) in incorporation into elongating DNA chain resulting in their cytotoxic or antiviral effect. Thus, the efficacy of NRTIs could be affected by direct competition with endogenous dNTPs and/or feedback inhibition of their metabolic enzymes. In this paper, we assessed whether the levels of ribonucleotides (RN) and dNTP pool sizes can be used as biomarkers in distinguishing between HIV-infected patients with ART-induced mitochondrial toxicity and HIV-infected patients without toxicity.
    We used data collected through a case-control study from 50 subjects. Cases were defined as HIV-infected individuals with clinical and/or laboratory evidence of mitochondrial toxicity. Each case was age, gender, and race matched with an HIV-positive without evidence of toxicity. We used a range of machine learning procedures to distinguish between patients with and without toxicity. Using resampling methods like Monte Carlo k-fold cross validation, we compared the accuracy of several machine learning algorithms applied to our data. We used the algorithm with highest classification accuracy rate in evaluating the diagnostic performance of 12 RN and 14 dNTP pool sizes as biomarkers of mitochondrial toxicity.
    We used eight classification algorithms to assess the diagnostic performance of RN and dNTP pool sizes distinguishing HIV patients with and without NRTI-associated mitochondrial toxicity. The algorithms resulted in cross-validated classification rates of 0.65–0.76 for dNTP and 0.72–0.83 for RN, following reduction of the dimensionality of the input data. The reduction of input variables improved the classification performance of the algorithms, with the most pronounced improvement for RN. Complex tree-based methods worked the best for both the deoxyribose dataset (Random Forest) and the ribose dataset (Classification Tree and AdaBoost), but it is worth noting that simple methods such as Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression were very competitive in terms of classification performance.
    Our finding of changes in RN and dNTP pools in participants with mitochondrial toxicity validates the importance of dNTP pools in mitochondrial function. Hence, levels of RN and dNTP pools can be used as biomarkers of ART-induced mitochondrial toxicity.

  abstract={Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated significant links between human brain structure and common DNA variants. Similar studies with rodents have been challenging because of smaller brain volumes. Using high field MRI (9.4 T) and compressed sensing, we have achieved microscopic resolution and sufficiently high throughput for rodent population studies. We generated whole brain structural MRI and diffusion connectomes for four diverse isogenic lines of mice (C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, CAST/EiJ, and BTBR) at spatial resolution 20,000 times higher than human connectomes. We measured narrow sense heritability (h2) I.e. the fraction of variance explained by strains in a simple ANOVA model for volumes and scalar diffusion metrics, and estimates of residual technical error for 166 regions in each hemisphere and connectivity between the regions. Volumes of discrete brain regions had the highest mean heritability (0.71 ± 0.23 SD, n = 332), followed by fractional anisotropy (0.54 ± 0.26), radial diffusivity (0.34 ± 0.022), and axial diffusivity (0.28 ± 0.19). Connection profiles were statistically different in 280 of 322 nodes across all four strains. Nearly 150 of the connection profiles were statistically different between the C57BL/6J, DBA/2J, and CAST/EiJ lines. Microscopic whole brain MRI/DTI has allowed us to identify significant heritable phenotypes in brain volume, scalar DTI metrics, and quantitative connectomes.},
