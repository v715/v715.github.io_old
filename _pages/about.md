I am an incoming PhD student in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics at the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology.
I develop machine learning methods for complex problems in healthcare, and am currently studying applications in cardiovascular disease.

I obtained my BS and MSE from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in 2021.
My past research has focused on the development of machine learning methods to analyze multi-subject neuroimaging data (advised by [Dr. Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me) and [Dr. Carey E. Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/)). Most recently, I developed statistical graph theory algorithms to perform biomarker discovery in network-valued maps of the brain. I also led a Design Team of undergraduate biomedical engineers (advised by [Dr. Elizabeth Logsdon](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/elizabeth-logsdon/) and [Dr. Rani Hasan](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/1571333/rani-hasan)).
We built a dynamic fusion image guidance system for minimally invasive heart surgery.
